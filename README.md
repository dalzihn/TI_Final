# Implementation of LSTM, Transformer-based LSTM and Transformer-based GRU for Stock Price Prediction
This is our project of implementing three models, which are LSTM, Transformer-based LSTM and Transformer-based GRU. In this project, we trained and tested three models on five diffrent stock codes originated from the Vietnam stock market.

# Project Overview
The repo has two folders, Code and Data:
- The Code folder contains code for building the three mentioned models. Specifically, the `TI_Final/Code/architecture.py` is the building file of the architectures for models, the `TI_Final/Code/data_setup.ipynb` has functions for setting up folders and data files,
  the `TI_Final/Code/engine.py` consists of functions for training and testing.
- The Data folder is divided into two smaller modules, `train` and `test`, `train` has the data for training while `test` has the data for testing.
